# Abstract

RFC documents may be drafted to propose new designs and to put existing designs into documentation.

Peer review is an important procedure to ensure that advised decisions will be made when designing complex things.

# Creation

Every comrade is encouraged to draft RFC documents, for the matters which he concerns, as a way to improve documentation and system reliability.

An RFC document should be created as an issue in a repository.

A

# Life Cycle

The life cycle of an RFC issue consists of:

- Initial Discussion Period
- Extended Discussion Period
- Ratification or Dismissal
- Documentation Merge

## Initial Discussion Period

Every comrade is encouraged to join the discussion.

The first 30 days after posting, which is defined as adding the label `RFC: Open` to the issue.

## Extended Discussion Period

However, every engagement will delay the deadline by 48 hours. Therefore, it is possible that an RFC may last several months if the discussion remains hot.

CTO may manually grant a 30-day extension for a particular RFC.

## Ratification or Dismissal

When the discussion period is over, the RFC may be ratified or dismissed. CTO and Product Principal will jointly make an advised decision regarding feedbacks to the RFC.

If it is ratified, its label will become `RFC: Ratified`, and the issue will be closed.

If it is dismissed, its label will become `RFC: Dismissed`, and the issue will be closed.

## Documentation Merge

Ultimately, a ratified RFC should be merged into the main documentation collection. This is managed by respective maintainers of the documentation collections.

# Reader Responsibility

It is assumed that a comrade will be notified about such issues if he is an important contributor of a repository. No comrade may object a ratified RFC by arguing that he was not aware of the discussion.

# Moderation

CTO and Product Principal may jointly dismiss an RFC if they both consider it irrelevant.
